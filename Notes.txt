because I'm doing it over one dimension that means there is only one concern: time.
This means that everything should be relative to time. Which means that the variable 'c'
should be in terms of (duration - startTime) because the change in value is really the duration that the interval plays over. This removes the variable, simplifies the equation, and should
let you be able to apply different tweening distributions now.
# t - current time
# b - start time
# c - change in value
# d - duration


Modify in-out to be out-in. Try and identify if you can do it mutliple different ways, then generalize that so each equation can be applied dynamically?

Used equation to fit points to bell curve for standard distribution?
